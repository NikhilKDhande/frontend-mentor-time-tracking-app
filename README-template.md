### Built with

- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project i learn how to manupulate the data according to data that is been given.
I use conditional rendaring for the background color and button color which is quite challenging because I have to think different way to apply respective background color. And also I learn how to work with avg file.
